Usage flow:
	1. run node hackproxy.js
	2. visit 127.0.0.1:8080
	3. type "http://github.com" in the input field, hit the button
	4. in hackproxy's dir/stored/github.com/ you'll have static files 
	   downloaded - edit them however you want.
	5. switch back to your browser, hit f5, watch your changes 
	   applied on the real site
	6. ...
	7. profit

... or it won't work. hackproxy is nowhere near ready yet,
    and it doesn't support many things.

TODO:
	1. parse @import rules, css rules, all possible rules
	2. decide what to do with .html (store? parameter maybe?)
	3. fix regexp's cause they suck now
	4. fix other things that suck now

important: include protocol! (http://www.foo.com = good, www.foo.com = bad)
